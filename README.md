# Book Worm

Book Worm is a book reviewing platform, allowing users to create an account, search for virtually any book by title, author or ISBN, and read/write reviews.
The app is hosted on Heroku, and has a database associated with it, which stores all user accounts, book reviews, etc. 

Tools used: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, SQL (Postgres), Goodreads API, Open Library Covers API

Project was inspired by Harvard's CS50 edX Course which gave me the necessary knowledge in back-end and front-end design to complete this web application
